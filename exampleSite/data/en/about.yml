      Moriarty Management caters primarily to the TV & Film world, working towards opportunities and
      credits that land within a certain industry standard of recognition.
      Whilst still growing, the Agency has very high ambitions and Casting Briefs are treated with the
      highest of respect.
      Commercials & Theatre are also covered, depending on the personal goal of an actor. That is,
      what they want to achieve and which area of the industry they want to specialise in.
