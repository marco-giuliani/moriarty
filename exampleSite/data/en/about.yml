    content: "The talent that exists in our industry is vast and unending. In a sea
      of the same, learning to stand out (in the right way), is key. \nThe strongest
      method of achieving this is by delivering world class performances in everything
      that you do: from Headshots to Self Tapes to on-set performance and everything
      in between. That is an incredible demand, and one the Agency acknowledges and
      strives for.\n\nIf you want to grow with Moriarty Management, you must be able
      to self analyse and grow, learn and strive for constant betterment.\nThis industry
      is a life choice, not a hobby.\n\nIf our philosophies still align, then you
      should definitely get in touch."
