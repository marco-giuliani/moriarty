At the age of 13, my family and I travelled in a motorhome around Europe for a year eventually stopping in Italy where we lived for a year. It was here where I found my love for acting and adventure; luckily the two seem to go hand in hand and I have thrown myself into both. 

I have attended a number of classes and schools and have travelled all over Europe gaining the life experience needed in order to portray a variety of characters. At the beginning of 2013 I travelled to the south of France on my own to hike the Camino De Santiago for a number of months. Also, after working through North and Central Italy in theatre for the first five months of this year, I pushed myself to walk a different, more difficult route on the Camino De Santiago hiking 815km over 5 weeks. Here I pushed and tested my limits in determination, motivation and character.

I love the possibility of meeting new people whilst immersing and challenging myself in new, exciting countries and characters.
